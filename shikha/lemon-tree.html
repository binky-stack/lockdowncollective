My first time being away from home without any family was for a school trip in the fifth grade.
These trips always consisted of what they referred to as ‘character building’ experiences, so
this time, we stayed at an Ashram and slept on considerably hard cots that sank close to the
floor.<br /><br />
We would wake up at the crack of dawn to meditate, followed by yoga, after which we would
proceed to the jungle nearby and graduate to more strenuous activities like tight rope walking
and tree climbing, none of which strengthened my character in my opinion, or came of any real
use to me ever again.<br /><br />
It was the second of four nights, and as a respite, the teachers had organized a bonfire.
Everyone was in a good mood: we sang songs individually and in groups, and danced around
the fire. I sang this song that goes, “Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flowers are sweet...
but the fruit of the lemon is impossible to eat.”<br />
I’m almost entirely sure that the name of that song is Lemon Tree, but I never really knew who
sang it. I only remember it in my mother’s voice, and my own, from this Ashram campsite, right
before the incident took place.<br /><br />
The bonfire was built inside a pit of sand, probably to provide some separation from the kids,
but it was that fact that made it so easy for my leg to slip in when I did.<br /><br />
I must have been dancing when my right leg slipped down the sand pit. By that point, It wasn’t
a roaring blaze, but more like the last dying, but still hot and glowing embers, which can burn
as hot as the real flame, as I would painfully realize.<br /><br />
A lot happened in the seconds that followed. Aishwarya, my best friend at the time, who also
happened to be my trip buddy, held onto my arm for dear life. Not hers, but my dear life,
because who knows how much more of me would have slipped in had she not done that.<br /><br /><br />

As can be said of most things: I don’t know if this thought occurred to me naturally or because
years of books and movies and TV had taught me so – but I saw a rapid flashback reel of my
decade long life. Nothing too interesting to report, no epiphanies, or change of heart, but I
thought of everyone that I was supposed to have thought of.<br /><br />
Aishwarya pulled me out, and I heard this girl yell “omg, stop laughing, it was SHIKHA.”<br /><br />
She was a typical mean girl – good at school, sports, extremely popular, and extremely mean,
and somehow, I was somewhat friends with her. She told me later that she originally thought
some other girl had fallen into the fire, and started roaring with laughter, but sobered up and

told everyone to stop laughing as soon as she realized it was me. That was the beginning of
the end of our friendship.<br /><br />
The rest of the night went by in a haze – I remember it in a sort of blinking montage – sitting in
a Jeep with two of my teachers sobbing and holding me – the empty hospital room where
everything was white, the walls the sheets, the equipment, (I had never seen a room so white
before) and this volunteer Spanish nurse who taught me how to say Leopard and Monkey in
Spanish.<br /><br />
The rest of the trip was a breeze in some ways. I couldn’t participate in any activity other than
meditation, and got to sleep in a much softer bed at night. My cast, from above my knee all the
way down to my toes, was so thick and none of my shoes actually fit anymore, and they made
the tallest kid lend his right sandal to me.<br /><br />
When I got home, my parents were told it was a routine small burn, and I could have this cast
and bandages removed as soon as we get to a doctor’s office. My mom rushed us straight
from the train station to our pediatrician. One look under my bandages, and Dr. Poonam told
mom to take me to the hospital immediately.<br /><br />
My doctor at Apollo Hospital was funny and friendly and always knew what to say to make me
feel better, but when he first saw my leg, he laughed nervously, “Wow, this is really all blood
and bones isn’t it.” and my mother fainted. “You’ll be fine,” he said, “but let’s order a stretcher
for your mom now, why don’t we.”<br /><br />
I would have to get the bandages and cast changed twice a week for the next six months,
followed by another year of wearing a tight skin-coloured custom fit leg support, which is often
used to prep the skin for skin graft surgeries. I protested any sort of surgery the entire time, and
thankfully I didn’t need it by the end of it, not unless i would want it for cosmetic purposes.<br /><br />
I never actually saw my leg in the first six months. After mom fainted at the sight of it, I decided
to let the doctor work on It while I lay flat on my back so I wouldn’t see any open wounds.<br /><br />
So the freakiest part of the entire ordeal for me was never really the burn, but a conversation
between my mother and Rohan had back home, the night I got my burn. It was around 10pm,
the time I would have been en route to the remote jungle hospital near the campsite. Rohan
was four, and mom handed him a glass of milk before bedtime.<br /><br />
He said, “Where is Shikha’s milk? You should give her some” and in response my mom
reminded him that I was on a school trip. “No, she’s in the hospital, mom, I know it” and mom
told him not to say such things and that I would be back home in a few days.<br />

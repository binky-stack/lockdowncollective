Lies<br />
I forget why we first broke up – it was something like he was too controlling or
aggressive or rude to my friends, but our codependence as 15 year olds who thought
they would have each others babies was frightful, so we were only really broken up on
paper, and only for about a month before we got back to being-together-forever.
    </p>
    <p>
Over the course of this month, while he seemed to have turned over a new leaf, he also
started peppering in his stories with a liver ache here and a blackout there, which led up
to his piece de resistance: that he had liver cirrhosis and needed a transplant surgery.
When your boyfriend tells you he has liver cirrhosis at 15, you believe it; because it’s too
outrageous to be a lie. He didn’t like talking about it much at all — just that it was really
nice to have someone support and love him at a time like this.
Friday after we were officially back together, I asked him when his surgery was, and he
said Monday. My suspicions slowly snuck in as the conversation continued:
<br /> <br />
I’ll be there, Where is it?
Apollo Hospital
Oh great that’s right next to my house
Not that one, this one’s on the other side of town.
There is only one Apollo Hospital in Delhi. So when do you get admitted?
8 am, and I’ll be out before you’re out of school so don’t bother.
Isn’t it an 8 hour surgery?
Won’t you need to be there for a while after the operation?
Don’t you need to be matched with a donor?
Are you trying to imply something?
<br /><br />
How dare you.
As a Hail Mary of my own I explained the situation to my mom.
She responded with:
He’s an idiot.
<br /><br />
I told him he was an idiot.
<br /><br />
He tried his best to stick to his charade and gaslight me in the process.
Two hours into a painfully circular phone call,
I said,
<br /><br />
Is there anything you have lied about;
Is there anything to want to admit to me?
<br /><br />
He finally broke,
I lied just about one thing.
I don’t have liver cirrhosis, I don’t need surgery.
<br /><br />
So what did you not lie about exactly?
<br /><br />
How much I love you.

To-do List
We had just watched Hateful Eight in 70mm at the Village East Cinema and we stepped
onto a recently-rattled-snow-globe of Second Avenue; It was my first snow in the city.
We picked up some dumplings and wine, and made our way back to his dorm where we
talked for hours before falling asleep to Hot Fuzz.
    </p>
    <p>
The next morning, we woke up to a raging snow storm and city wide text alerts – he still
had to make his shift at the Grey Dog, and said he’d back in about 5 hours so I slept for
another three. After waking up and lounging around on my phone, I decided I might as
well get started with a mind map we were assigned for my thesis class. I walked over to
his desk in hunt for a pen, instead I found a note with my name on it. It had my name on
it for god’s sakes so it meant I was allowed to read it, and he hadn’t attempted to hide it
in any case so this couldn’t be too bad.
<br /><br />
The note turned out to be a to-do list –
<br /><br />
1. Break up with Shikha
2. Break up with Becca
3. Continue dating Holly
        <br /><br />
This was so ridiculous that I had to take a photo – it would be hard to convince even
myself that I didn’t make this up. I video called my best friends and we see-sawed
between rage and laughter. I wasn’t at all heartbroken, I just felt a bizarre mix of
amused and indignant – I was in a shitty comedy.<br />
I decided to leave this note on his bed after adding a little ✅ next to the first agenda
item. City wide alerts told me the subways and roads would be closing in an hour so I
needed to leave if I wanted to make my way home that night.<br />
Satisfied with my move, I packed up and made my way out, only to be interrupted by the
NYU guard at the lobby. She said she couldn’t let me leave before my host signed me
out – I could wait in the lobby or go back to his dorm room.<br />
I went back up and decided to hide the note, but he returned and asked me how my day
went, I couldn’t hold it in. He was contrite and full of excuses, but I cut him short – I
didn’t care and all I wanted then was some food; I hadn’t eaten in 18 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
We spent the rest of the weekend smoking weed, eating leftovers from the Cafe, and
waiting for the storm to pass. It turned out to be exactly like that movie 2 Night Stand,
except the outcome of that weekend wasn’t the beginning of a love story, but an end to
one.

He told me on our second date that he didn’t believe in monogamy. I liked him but I was
young and still dipping my toes in the new york city dating pool, so I said what the heck.
We continued getting to know each other over dinner dates and bike rides, but I knew
he was seeing other people, so when I met this other great guy who asked me out, I
said yes.
    </p>
    <p>
This rubbed him the wrong way – he was very jealous of my new romantic prospect,
and started acting aggressively about it. The new relationship bloomed and the new guy
soon proposed that we stop seeing other people, so I ended things with Kostya.
    </p>
    <p>
He took it well, or so I thought. A couple of weeks later, I got a phone call from him
inviting me to go on a walk with him to the park. I said I was tired and maybe some
other time, but he pleaded and said he was downstairs.
    </p>
I noticed he had his guitar on his back, but assumed he was on his way back from
practice or something. As soon as we reached the park and found a bench, he whipped
out the guitar and started singing –
The song was 6 verses long and transcribed our month long relationship, and the
chorus went, “It’s not fair to me Shikha” – worst of all, it was laid out to the melody of
    “With A Little Help From My Friends" by the Beatles.</p>
<p>
I said I was extremely flattered but my answer was still no.
“Also – It’s not fair to me!”
He responded with, “Yeah, I thought you’d start harmonizing with me”
    </p> 
    <p>
Later that night my inbox had a new email from him – he had sent me a recording of the
song, and a PDF of the lyrics with the chords laid out, in case I ever wanted to sing
along.
    </p>
    <p>
Damn Good Argument<br />
He broke up with me at the end of a four hour long date with,
<br /><br />
“You don’t deserve the darkness that is my life”
I couldn’t argue with that.
    </p>
        <p>
Black and White Dress<br />
He was smart and funny and could be kind at times, but he was too self involved and
insecure from having lived in his brothers famous and successful shadows, and from his
girlfriend of four years having recently dumped him.
I was starting to realize It wasn’t my trade or recreation to save men from themselves,
so I broke up with him after a month of dating. Later in the year, we ran into each other
and hung out as friends on a few occasions before the dynamic slipped back into
something more romantic.
    </p>
    <p>
We liked spending time with each other but it was too inconsistent and unreliable for
me, so I told him that If I were to meet somebody I like the next week, I would go on a
date with them, and he accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
The next week, I agreed to be my roommate’s date to a wedding at the last minute.
Sure enough, I met a wonderful man that night and he asked me out.
Even the first two dates with Dan were better than the last five months, so my decision
was easy.

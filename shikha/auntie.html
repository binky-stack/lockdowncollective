  <h2>Aunty</h2>

    <p> 

Sampurna Aunty would pick me up in the afternoons from where the school bus would drop us
off, already having done the same for Rohan a half hour ago. On the walk home we would talk
about school or what she had laid out for us for lunch, or the fresh flower lined balconies, or
about that big house near the parking lot that lay in such disuse that endlessly growing vines
spread their veins through every crack in the wall and the paint unhurriedly peeled off the to be
replaced by a silky, sickly grey layer of cobwebs. She was very afraid of walking by that house
in the evenings and early foggy mornings, and so was I.<br>
I never really knew where she lived, only the neighbourhood. I knew she took an hour long bus
home, and I know that our family had known her a while so when I was two and my mom
needed a nanny, she was the first and only choice.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
Paati had a love hate relationship with her, and she does with many people. She would yell at
her for innocent mistakes, and when mom got home at 6, I would run up to mom and tell her
what happened and why Paati looked so smug and Aunty was sulking. My mom would walk
Aunty out at 6:15 (that’s when Aunty left to catch her bus) she would apologize on Paati’s
behalf, and more often than not, she would give her some extra cash for her daughter.
<br>
Aunty’s daughter would come over once in six months to spend the day with us. She was
elegant and kind, and Meenakshi grew up to be a Flight Attendant, and have a baby of her
own, which now made Aunty a grandmother, I couldn’t believe it!
<br>
Paati might hate someone but she can’t stand the thought of anybody disliking her, so every
once in a while she would turn up the charm and gift her some sarees or teach her a new
recipe, and they would chat away the afternoon in Tamil perched on the dining table, and all
the while Aunty was to still be chopping vegetables for dinnertime.
<br>
    </p>
    <p>
On some days in May after Rohan and I were exhausted from biking around with Dia or playing
badminton, we would come home and discreetly ask Aunty to make something more exciting
than the usual, and Aunty would whip up some Aloo parathas. I’ll eat the other vegetables
tomorrow, don’t worry, she’d whisper. When Paati napped after her long morning of teaching
music to little kids from the neighbourhood, and catching up on the phone with every relative
she ever knew, the three of us played Snakes and Ladders on the floor. We each had sliced
mangoes in our own bowls, and Lizzie Mcquire went about her day in the background; we
switched to the audio dubbed in Hindi when Aunty watched with us.
<br>
Aunty spoke Hindi and Tamil, so we spoke in Hindi, and she taught me a few words here and
there in Tamil that I couldn’t ask Paati for – like bitch or butt or “I don’t like this food”
Sometimes she would ask me to write Sampurna on a piece of paper in English script and she
would keep it in her purse.
        <br/> </p> 
    <p>
Last December I looked through some old photos curated across 6 or 7 Kodak albums, and I
saw these photos of her - helping baby Rohan sit up on his purple bike in the balcony, helping
me dress baby Rohan up in my skirts, and her chopping a funny shaped Tomato.
        <br></p>
    <p>
After I started college and Rohan was grown up enough, she stopped coming to our house and
started looking after this baby for a different family. She would come by every couple of years
after, and always remember our birthdays, but now I don’t remember the last time I saw her, it
could be more than four years ago. I always think of her when I see a hauntingly abandoned
house, and always on the 25th of March, that was her birthday.
<br>
She always said, “I can’t wait for your wedding, Shikhu, I’ll dance all night.”<br>
If I get married, I think I want her to be my bridesmaid.

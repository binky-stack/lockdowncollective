     INT - KITCHEN, 12:43 AM, ONE MONTH LATER <br />   <br />  
     
     ODIE
        <br />  
     So, did you think of a way to kill him?
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT 
        <br />  
        A feww, but that seems all too simplistic now. 
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE <br />  
        I thought that's what you liked about it. 
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT 
        <br />  
        I don't want him to die anymore, I want him to suffer.
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE (slightly smirking) 
        <br />  
        Ah, so it's true what they say: time does heal all wounds. 
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        Perhaps I might possibly even begin to acknowledge your 
        facetious remark if I found that the situation was even remotely calling for hilarity.
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE
        <br />  
        I apologize. So why the change of heart from murderous to sadistic? 
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        He's moving out, or so I've heard.
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE
        <br />  
        Oh that's huge. Good riddance, right?
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        Absolutely (hesitant)
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE 
        <br />  
        But...?
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        Nothing feels like a victory.
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE
        <br />  
        I don't know, doesn't he lose everyone he loved?
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        With what heart?
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE
        <br />  
        What does your therapist think?
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT (gazing, distant)
        <br /> 
        I had this insidious dream where everything was normal. HE was there, SHE was too. Everything was normal, and I was me.
        But I was also a child at the same time <br />  
        It even felt <i>nice</i>.
        <br />   <br />  
        
        ODIE
        <br />  
        As if nothing had happened?
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        No, that's the thing. It had. In the dream, I knew. 
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE
        <br />  
        Hm, I see 'insidious' now.
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        It could never play out like that in real life.
        <br />  <br />  
        
        ODIE
        <br />  
        Maybe ten years from now if you f-
        <br />  <br />  
        
        DOT
        <br />  
        Don't even say it. Not happening. SHE hasn't come this far for it to come undone. 
        <br /> <br />
        
    ODIE
        <br />
        Okay okay. So, what does your therapist think?
        <br /><br />
        
        DOT
        <br />
        She wants me to write about the good stuff.
        <br /><br />
        
        ODIE<br />
        How's that going?
        <br /><br />
        
        DOT
        <br />
        I made a list of ways to hurt him. 
        <br /><br />
        
    ODIE
        <br />
        Lay it on me. 
        <br /><br />
        
        DOT
        <br />
        Cut up all his suits, and write a death threat on his office wall with the cuttings.
        <br /><br />
        
        ODIE
        <br />
        He does love all 80 of his suits.
        <br /><br />
        
        DOT
        <br />
        Try about 150, he took over our closets when we left. 
        <br /><br />
        
        ODIE
        <br />
        Maybe kidnap his suits, and send a ransom note. 
        <br /><br />
        
        DOT (emphatically)
        <br />
        YES, great! Now you're getting the hang of this.
        <br /><br />
        
        ODIE
        <br />
        ...and we write the ransom note with what's leftover of the ties.
        <br /><br />
    DOT
        <br />
        Make a million dollars and sign them off to everyone but him.
        <br /><br />
        
        ODIE<br />
        Start a not him club.
        <br /><br />
        
         DOT
        <br />
        Change my last name to something else.
        <br /> <br />
        
         ODIE
        <br />
        I wouldn't even know how to recognize you. Just drop the last name. 
         <br /> <br />
        
        DOT <br />
        Write a letter to the IRDA and get him fired.
         <br /> <br />
        
        ODIE
         <br />
        Eat all the butterscotch ice cream in the country so he can never have any. 
         <br /> <br />
        
        DOT  <br />
        I can't think of much more he holds dear. 
         <br /> <br />
        
        ODIE
         <br />
        How's your brother taking it, now that he knows?
         <br /> <br />
        
        DOT 
         <br />
        He's an absolute champ. Handling it better than I did. 
         <br /> <br />
        
        ODIE
         <br />
        Just give it time to sink in.
         <br /> <br />
        
        DOT  <br />
        Well, I'll be here.
         <br /> <br />
        ODIE <br />
        Yes...with your list of ways to hurt and murder. Patent pending. <br /> <br />
        
        DOT <br />
        He couldn't fucking believe about the daughter. I feel bad for her, really.
         <br /> <br />
        
        ODIE
         <br />
        That child might grow up to be a serial killer.
         <br /> <br />
        DOT
         <br />
        I would have been so messed up if not for <i> HER</i>.
         <br /> <br />
        ODIE <br />
        Yeah, is she relieved?
         <br /> <br />
        
        DOT <br />
        No, not really. Not as much as one would think. 10 years of being trapped in a land that lays still and not saying anything: I think it builds up.
         <br /> <br />
        
        ODIE <br />
        So, is she telling people?
         <br /> <br />
        
        DOT <br />
        Nope. He is begging and says he will fix things, and she's nice to a fault.
         <br /> <br />
        
        ODIE
         <br />
        Hm, I knew someone like that once. 
         <br /> <br />
        DOT
         <br />
        Cmon. I'm the baddest bitch now.
         <br /> <br />
        ODIE

(smirking)<br /> That is the goal.<br /><br />

DOT<br />

I don't know what to do, I don't want
her to believe him.
        <br /><br />
ODIE<br />

So nobody outside of the little circle
knows?
        <br /><br />

DOT<br />

No, I desperately want the world to
know.
<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

And he obviously doesn't. Does she?
<br /><br />
DOT<br />

I'm not sure at this point.
(CONT'D)
He still... (sighs) gets away with
everything.<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

Is she still scared? Are you?
<br /><br />
DOT<br />

I am the opposite of scared. But I'm
not stupid, I know what he is capable
of.
<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

So what can you do now?
<br /><br />
DOT<br />

I can't tell anybody if she won't let
me, I can't make any of it stop,
still.

(CONT'D) It continues to hurt her.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
So, destroy his suits?
<br /><br />
DOT<br />
Yeah, (PAUSE)
then kill him.
        <br /><br />
ODIE<br />
Naturally.

INT - KITCHEN, 12:43 AM <br />
DOT AND ODIE are sitting ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER at the
KITCHEN TABLE.
<br /><br />
        
DOT
<br />
So, what is the best way to kill
someone, do you think?
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
You mean the best way to kill him?
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
An eye for an eye, right, why fucking
not?
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
What exactly is the "eye" here?
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
The first eye or the second eye?
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Well the first eye is murder.
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
Yeah, I could get away with it, after
some research maybe.
        <br /><br />
ODIE
        <br />
You're too far away.
        <br /><br />
DOT
<br />
We're in a digital age, it's 2020,
it's the "new normal" - shouldn't
there be a way to do just about
ANYTHING I want online?
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Yeah yeah, I'll throw The new normal.
up if i hear that phrase one more
time.
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
I have to find a way - My brain can't
see any other way, there's no end in
sight.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Do you think his daughter will miss
him? Miss knowing him?

<br /><br />

DOT
<br />
I fucking forgot about his daughter.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Yeah, that's a fucking doozy.
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
So, back to the main point here.
What are we going to do with this
problem?<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Right. So you have known everything
for how long now?<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
Since January 3rd, told me SHE
everything a day after her birthday,
when it was just the two of us in her
car.
<br /><br />
ODIE<br />
I wonder why . now<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
Because I asked her. I straight up
asked her.<br /><br />
ODIE<br />
You asked her what?<br /><br />
DOT<br />

I asked her if - if everything was
okay wi...<br /><br />
ODIE<br />
- So you knew?<br /><br />
DOT<br />
NO way, never!<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

I guess she never saw it coming
either, not always.<br /><br />
DOT<br />

No, she's pretty shaken. So I gotta
help her out, I have to do something.<br /><br />

ODIE
<br />
Help her out or yourself out?<br /><br />

DOT<br />
Two birds.<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

Okay, so do something, something short
of murder?!<br /><br />
DOT<br />

What is short of murder? Fighting?
Admonishing, Screaming? Disapproving?
Shaming?<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

Any of those might be a better place
to start, yeah.<br /><br />
DOT<br />

Sure, but i can't do any of those, and
even if I could I wouldn't know where
to begin.<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

Are you scared of him?<br /><br />

DOT<br />

I don't know what I am of him, that's
the problem. I'm too close to it all.<br /><br />

ODIE<br />
Why not talk to him?<br /><br />

DOT
<br />
Yeah so that's the thing, i can't. She
won't let me. She doesn't want me to
tell him or anyone else anything I
know.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
So if you say something then you hurt
her, and if you don't do anything then
you hurt yourself?<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
She's done so much for me, too much. I
have to do this for her.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
So you're one of a handful of people


who knows, but he doesn't know you
know?
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
Sure me and about fifty strangers who
were there. And no he doesn't know. He
has his suspicions though, he can't
look me in the eye anymore.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Maybe he senses that you want to kill
him.
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
I dream about him, I dream about HER,
I dream about it. Every night, almost.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
I'm sorry, that's stressful. Maybe you
should talk to someone, a
professional?<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
You think I haven't tried? Every week
since January my therapist and I have
been trying to chip away at it.
<br /><br />
ODIE<br />
And? Zero progress?<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
No, we agreed we can't make any
progress until something else happens.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
So. You can't talk to him. or tell
anyone else, and he gets away with
everything.<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
Yeah, and there's no closure or
resolution, and it will just continue
to haunt me when I'm asleep or awake
and brushing my teeth, or driving to
the studio, or shopping for groceries.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Why can't do anything about it - She
what is she doing about it?! She was
there, hell she was there. right
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
Yeah but that's a dead end. I told you
(irritated) - She's the most selfless
person I know.
and she hates confrontation, she can't
do anything.<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
She do anything. won't
<br /><br />
DOT
<br />
No, she won't, not until she moves
some money around.<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
Okay, I guess you wait for her to do
all that, right?<br /><br />
DOT<br />

I can't, that will never happen.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
What?!<br /><br />

DOT<br />

I know she won't ever do it, she will
never really make moves, she doesn't
want to ruffle any feathers, she's
scared too.<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

Yeah, I would be, I don't blame her.<br /><br />

ODIE<br />

So you think it will never happen?!<br /><br />

DOT<br />

No, Nothing will ever change or move
and it will just torture and Her
plague me for the rest of our lives.
<br /><br />
ODIE
<br />
...and he will get away with it.

I can't, I just can't deal with any of
it longer.<br /><br />
ODIE<br />

So you don't want to wait, but you



can't do anything about it.<br /><br />

DOT<br />

I can't talk to him, I can't tell
anyone else, I can't make her do
anything about it, and more than
anything, I just can't do this any
longer.<br /><br />

ODIE<br />

So you have to kill him.<br /><br />

DOT<br />
So it seems.

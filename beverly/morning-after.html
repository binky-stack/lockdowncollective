<p class="work-text">

We entered the park as usual<br>
Macy ate grass, I started to jog<br>
A runner in tangerine trainers passed us<br>
and turned into a cyclone of dust<br><br>
Macy shot herself out of a cannon<br>
landed in cattails and dandelions<br>
She slept for just a minute<br>
Z’s flew out of her wet black nose<br><br>
I slogged on towards her<br>
shedding sweat like big tear drops<br>
I caught them in my hand, Macy drank them<br>
We were all cartoon characters<br><br>
A stick figure mother pushed a pram<br>
and spoke into a pulsing mobile phone<br>
saying blah blah blah blah<br>
in speech bubbles above her head<br><br>
Above the prison were zig zag lines<br>
pulsating black and red radio waves<br>
low level rumbling struggled to smuggle<br>
out through barred windows<br><br>
An outline of a father and son<br>
watched a helicopter land in the parking lot<br>
outside the hospital, propeller spinning out<br>
prayers, let them live, let them live<br><br>
Still animated we headed towards home<br>
On our tail were a couple of crows cawing<br>
schmuck, schmuck, schmuck, schmuck<br>
Their words landed like shit on our shoulders<br><br>
Back on the street we fell into step<br>
walking slowly behind people in masks<br>
Our neighbour called out from his bedroom window<br>
I’ve missed you, how are you, where have you been?

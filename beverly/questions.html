Walked in woods with Angie who’s nearly 90<br>
she was in an aqua track suit and a cardie<br>
I wore a flowery dress and nettles stung my legs<br>
Angie said to look for healing dock leaves<br>
but I didn’t know what they looked like<br>
she asked <i>where you were raised</i><br><br>
Ran in the big scrubs with Macy<br>
stopped for a distanced conversation<br>
with a bald man covered in tattoos<br>
he was drawing tower blocks in charcoal<br>
he was a bus driver he hated Andy Warhol<br>
he asked <i>where you are from</i><br><br>
When I was 13 I went to Jill Coralnick’s house<br>
to sit in her immaculate bedroom<br>
and listen to Queen’s Night at the Opera<br>
she told me that her parents were always angry<br>
when I met them they had some questions<br>
like <i>where are your people from</i><br><br>
I told my parents how I answered<br>
my grandparents came from the Bronx<br>
with Yiddish accents and brown paper shopping bags<br>
filled with boxes of underwear from the lower east side<br>
my parents laughed for hours, I did too<br>
not really understanding any of it

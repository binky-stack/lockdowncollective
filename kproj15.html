<strong>EXT. LOS ANGELES COMPLEX. DAY</strong><br /><br />

<strong>JACK (27)</strong> a Tik Tok star, hops down the steps of his two
story complex, breathing in the afternoon air.<br /><br />

<strong>JACK</strong><br />
(sotto)<br />
You’re unique and you’re special.<br />
They need you. They all need you.<br /><br />

Jack jumps to the bottom and does a burpee. He pops back up,
out of breath.
Jack walks the courtyard confidently, he passes by MRS PEREZ
smoking parliaments in her rocking chair, aggressively
rolling over her rose garden.<br /><br />
<strong>JACK (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Morning Mrs Perez!<br />

<strong>MRS PEREZ</strong><br />

That’s what you think, you baboon!<br />

<strong>JACK</strong><br />
Well alright then!<br />

<strong>MRS PEREZ</strong><br />
Freakin moron.<br /><br />

She rips one of the roses right out the ground, and tosses it
at him.
Jack continues on his way. He sees a commotion at the end of
the court yard. Instinctively, he goes for his phone, starts
recording.<br />
<strong>ON JACK’S PHONE:</strong> Jack approaches the small crowd of
neighbors. They’re fit, good looking twenty somethings, all
filming personal testimonials on their own phones. He
continues to talk to his viewers.<br /><br />
<strong>SHERRY (20s)</strong> has a concern look on her perfectly contoured
face, talks into her phone.<br /><br />
<strong>SHERRY</strong><br />

I came down here and was like
what’s going on? And then I saw
what was going on. And I was still
like, ‘what’?<br /><br />
<strong>JACK</strong><br />

Never a dull moment here.

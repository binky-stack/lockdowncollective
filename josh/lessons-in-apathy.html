  <h2>LESSONS IN APATHY</h2>

    <p>There’s an annoying cliche people will use when they’re talking about teaching. It 
      sounds something like “I thought I would be teaching them, but they ended up teaching me.”
      Personally, I regret every time I made this stupid joke while teaching 5th graders writing in Chinatown this past summer, and if I truly learned anything from my students it’s that kids are boring and they love farts. That might also be a cliche, but it’s way too true not to mention. They honestly really love farts. The classroom usually smelled like literal shit after the first 20 minutes of a three hour period. Other lessons they offered included cheat codes for Team Fortress 2, the kinds of food that made them nauseous and why their parents were very ugly and tall, though it was hard to focus on any of these nuggets because of the constant stream of fart gas wafting from their filthy bodies. Another thing I learned: kids have no shame.</p>
    <p>I’d be lying if I said I didn’t learn anything substantive during my time at the Knugenx 
      Learning Center (“Knugenx” pronounced “new gen x” which, no, makes no sense), but I’m not 
      prepared to give the kids much credit. If anything, it was usually their abject complacency that inspired some of my better realizations, things like “I’ll never make all 16 kids understand what a predicate is” or “Stephen Wu is a prick and nothing can change him.”</p>
      <p>
        Most profound during my two month tenure at the program though was realizing that 
        there was a lesson I actually wanted to teach. The lesson was, unsurprisingly, largely ignored by 
        the kids, but then they couldn’t even pay attention to me when I tried to get on their level and 
        talk butts and poo so I shouldn’t have expected much. And while their blatant rejection of 
        everything I did/said/stood for had gradually embittered me towards each of their fat, vacant 
        faces, in this case I found trying to dole out some wisdom satisfying in itself. Yes, it didn’t matter 
        so much whether or not the kids actually gave a shit, the joy was in trying to make a difference. I 
        didn’t have much going on this summer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So like the majority of my lesson plans, this particular lecture was largely 
        improvisational. Outside of the writing prompts and grammar lessons handed down by the 
        Knugenx higher ups, I was essentially left to my own devices for the full three hour block from 9 
        to 12 AM, and when I wasn’t letting the kids throw rolled up wads of notebook paper into the 
        garbage can, I was usually fielding the same inane question over and over again: 
        “Do we have to finish the work today?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m sure at some point every single one of my students blurted out this question, some 
doing so just for the sake of making a noise, others, more bafflingly to me, genuinely looking for 
an answer. Baffling because for the majority of my time at Knugenx, the answer would be the 
same: a clipped, reactionary “yes.” Sometimes I would change it up with a “duh” or “what else 
do you think you should be doing?” and on a really bad day I would give them a monotonous 
“dumb question,” before feeling bad and overcompensating with a too-friendly “yeah if you could 
try and finish up your writing today that’d be great.... buddy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point I stopped worrying how I should respond because I knew I would be 
        answering the same useless question again within the next five to ten minutes. They were just 
        that desperate to know whether the class time specifically set aside for getting their work done 
        could be used for literally anything other than getting their fucking work done; their dream 
        response I’m sure being something like “no, you don’t have to finish your work, now everyone 
        pick a partner and start punching each other in the head” (I should probably mention that the 
        program was about 85% boys). And eventually there come a point where, and please excuse 
        another tired cliche, I couldn’t take their stupid bullshit anymore. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen Wu (Stephen fucking Wu) raised his hand but didn’t wait to be called on and 
        just started talking, which in itself is just viscerally irritating. My patience was already low, so I 
        had to stop the Wu boy before he could get all the way the through the classic Knugenx refrain 
        of “do we have to?” and did my best to get the rest of the class’ attention.“Guys... guys, c’mon I’m speaking... Feng put that away, we’ll play paper basketball 
        later. Okay, so I just want to address a question that’s come up a lot. You all keep asking me if 
        you have to finish the work, or if you can do it later, and all this stuff. And look... I have to say 
        yes, like I have to, it’s my job, I can’t tell you you don’t have to work, that’s crazy. But if you guys 
        don’t want to do the work, and you do, but if you really don’t feel like working then just... don’t 
        tell me. And see if you can get away with just. doing what you want... Be accountable for 
        yourselves. I don’t have to know everything that’s going on with you, and sometimes I’ll catch 
        you goofing off and tell you to get back to work. But sometimes I won’t. And once you realize 
        that, you’ll realize.... you’ll realize that you don’t have to come to me with every question, 
        complaint or whatever else that pops into your heads, and that you can kind of just be in charge 
        of yourselves a bit. Just like... be cool, okay?” 
      </p>
      <p>
        No one was listening. I guess that shouldn’t have been surprising after having two 
months to get used to their hardcore apathy, but I felt like my little speech was pretty edgy and 
subversive, the sort of stuff I thought kids are really into these days. And though it clearly wasn’t 
the most positive message to give to a room of eleven year olds, and you could make a pretty 
compelling argument that I was just telling them to slack off all the time if they wanted to and 
doing the exact opposite of what a teacher is paid to do (I shouldn’t have been paid), I genuinely 
believed in the advice I gave them. It’s advice I wish someone had given me back when I had to 
go to Hebrew school every Sunday, where I was forced to complete tedious worksheets that 
had us writing “shalom” over and over again that were never graded or even looked at. But 
instead of keeping to myself and waiting for when I could leave for the day, I would whine like 
Stephen Wu and force the instructors to tell me I had no choice but to do the work. I’m sure I 
wasn’t as annoying as Stephen but nothing ever could be, I’m certain of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my speech seemed like it was all for nought in terms of actually teaching anything. 
And like I said, that was okay, I enjoyed just saying it all. It was cathartic. Of course I still hoped 
that someone was paying attention, so after I finished saying my piece I did a quick scan of the 
room, trying to find a student who was at least trying to look like they gave a shit. That’s when I 
noticed Hong Le Huang, head leaning against the wall, eyes cast downward, desk completely 
fucking empty. I couldn’t tell if he had been like that for five minutes or the entire two and a half 
hours we had been in class and that was kind of the beauty of the whole thing. Whether he had 
actually heard my speech or not, he was living proof of the quality of my advice, the perfect 
example of a kid keeping to himself and reaping the rewards of being left to sit and stare at the 
wall. Hong Le was smart enough let me deal with his obnoxious classmates while he did 
absolutely fuck all for only he knows how long. In that moment I already decided he would get 
the best grade in the class for the summer. And that he was my hero really. And when Stephen 
Wu ratted Hong Le out, I sent him the snitch to the corner and genuinely hoped that he would 
learn his lesson.

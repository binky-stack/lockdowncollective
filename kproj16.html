<p class="work-text">
I want to be crammed in the backseat of a new friend’s car, hugging my bags on my lap - the
same bags that travelled in the boot of the car on the way to our destination, but somehow no
longer fit back there on the way home. Everything spreads on the way home. The bond that
we’ve spent the last few days forming, spend the car ride recapping it and groaning about lives
waiting for us at home. I want my new friend to turn up the volume on their trap song that
doesn’t really fit the mood of the car. I want to side eye the person next to me, smiling
secretively: we’ll let them have their moment, but as soon as it’s done we’ll switch back to
classic rock, real road music.<br /><br />
My old friend - my way into this group - I want to wiggle an arm free so I can show them
something on my phone. A text from someone we both know from the good old days. Or a
photo from school. Or a cute dog. Something that reestablishes our shorthand.<br /><br />
I want that moment of realization, when it becomes clear that this small group of people might
never spend time together again. That it might have worked this one time for this one trip. Any
inside jokes or embarrassing moment might live and die on this car ride home. It’s not about
friendships that will last a lifetime, it’s about the shared need to do something different with a
enough people there to witness your ability to change your environment.<br /><br />
When we pull up to the curb, I want to spill out onto the pavement, giggling all the way down,
my fall cushioned by my trusted luggage, my pillow, my sleeping bag. I want to stumble to my
feet and awkwardly stick my head back in the car, thanking my new friend for driving, thanking
my old friend for inviting me, seeing on everyone’s faces that I’d better wrap up the niceties
because they all want to get home. I want to slam the car door shut and wonder how the air
smells like nostalgia after such a short period away.<br /><br />
I want to return to my room in the state that I left it: a shambles. I want to remember how
before I left for this trip I had considered how nice it would be to return to clean sheets, a fresh
rubbish bag in the kitchen, an organized world, and even though I knew the benefits of coming
home in this fashion, I still didn’t make time to make it happen. I want to laugh at my
disorganized self of the days before. I want to take out the smelly, now rotting garbage and
strip my bed, using all the new found energy that comes when you’ve been away. That spring
board energy that you know won’t last once faced with the tight schedules of normalcy.<br /><br />
I want to bask in that cognitive dissonance from the monotony of my life that drags me down,
and I want think about ways to prune my world in the hopes of further exposing the
perspective this trip has given me. I know this feeling will fade into the background as soon as I
am swept back into my routine, but it’s a touchstone. A gemstone. Sand in my shoes.

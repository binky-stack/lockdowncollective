<h1 class="work-title">A Good Lockdown</h1>
<h3 class="work-author">by Michael Frydman</h3>

<p class="work-text">

Fair cop: I’ve been one of the lucky (silent) minority that has had a good
lockdown. Like some consultants, creative workers, Joe Biden and resume
editors (diplomas as well), I not only don’t miss my job as defined by an office
environment, truth is I’m kind of thriving outside of it. I mostly trade a variety
of financial instruments on-line in an effort to make money (call me a ‘day
trader’ at your peril) and this C19-led volatility has been relatively kind to me.
Meantime, not that I care much about social norms, it’s still nice to note
sometimes that trading financial markets in your pajamas from a laptop isn’t
viewed as quite as sad as it used to be. Take that - at least for the next 10 weeks -
all you fancy pants lawyers in fancy pants.<br><br>

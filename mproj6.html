‘It’s not what I know, its what I can prove…..’


Danny: &#39;<br>

&quot;Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be
guarded by men with guns. Who&#39;s gonna do it? You? You, Lt.
Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly
fathom. You weep for Santiago, and you curse the marines. You have
that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That
Santiago&#39;s death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence,
while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.&quot;
<br><br>
Shikha: 
<br>
You don&#39;t want the truth because deep down in
places you don&#39;t talk about at parties, you want me
on that wall -- you need me on that wall.
We use words like &quot;honor,&quot; &quot;code,&quot; &quot;loyalty.&quot; We use
these words as the backbone of a life spent
defending something. You use them as a punch line.
<br><br>
Katie: 
<br>
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain
myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the
blanket of the very freedom that I provide and then
questions the manner in which I provide it.
I would rather that you just said &quot;thank you&quot; and
went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up
a weapon and stand the post. Either way, I don&#39;t
give a DAMN what you think you are entitled to!
<br><br>
Olivia and Josh:
<br>
LTJG Kaffee: Did you order the Code Red?
Col Jessup: I did the job --
LTJG Kaffee: -- Did you order the Code Red?!
Col Jessup: YOU&#39;RE GOD DAMN RIGHT I DID!!!
<br><br>

5.1  Josh, grab you guitar <br><br>

please play a bit of the &#39;steeple&#39; / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBDbUVXXp-U&amp;ab_channel=SearchlightPictures" target="_blank">
song from Juno</a> <br>

 <br><br>
Q.  name the movie where the daughter sings a song (twice) to her father that&#39;s
so fucking similar to the Juno song that it ruined what I thought was going to be
a wonderful trivia question.<br>

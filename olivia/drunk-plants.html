    <p>Drunk Plants, dialogue transcribed<br /><br />
    The dad is a drunk who's hardly around but they love him still. <br />
    Are all of her paintings about her traumas/ insecurities? They all had the same face. <br />
    Have you ever wondered? If there are things you don't remember? <br />
    Doesn't sound very nutritious.<br /><br />
    One time I saw the moon become a sky God.<br />

    He's a foe of the east coast.<br />

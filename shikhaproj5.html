<i>Giddy</i><br>
The park beside my childhood home smelled like jasmine, if you played your cards right. It was strongest
at night, when I would walk by the side of the glowing diamond and emerald shrubs. A rare occurrence - I
was the first child and a daughter to very careful parents, and that sealed my fate of having to return
home before sundown each night.
Almost as if fragrances could be locked away with a password, I had to be in just the right mood. A great,
somewhat giddy, dreamlike mood – either thinking of a family vacation, or a boy I had been talking to –
and the jasmine flowers danced around me.<br><br>

<i>Dumbasses</i><br>
In the 7th grade, the teacher decided to pair us up with boys while assigning seats for the year.
Maybe she was encouraging us to fraternize with the so called enemy - but we had already started
mingling, some of us even consorting, by the 7th grade.<br>
In a random draw one morning, Harshit and I were chosen to be partners for the year. The other boys
always teased him a lot; and it didn't help that he was a particular flavour of annoying. They started calling
him G-less (G: short for a crass word that means butt. why boys that age were expected to have fully
rounded butts I have no idea.)<br>
From G it morphed into Genie, and then to Aladdin; they didn't need a good reason, or any reason to do
stupid things. Apparently he had a crush on me so I was deemed Jasmine, and was stuck with it for years
to follow. It wasn't really a bad nickname for me at all - other kids would tell me I should be flattered,
really; but I felt bad for Harshit, and wasn't inclined to participate in this asinine bullying ritual, so for the
rest of school life, I used it as a signal - if someone called out to me, "Jasmine", I knew a dumbass was
about to start a conversation with me, and I would be mentally prepared.<br><br>

<i>Tradition</i><br>
Half of my family is from the south – Chennai, Pondicherry, Bangalore, Kerala and the ancestral town of
Manjeri – Lands of magnificent temples, hot blistering beach towns, dosas and coconut chutneys,
Kanjeevaram silk sarees, and bunches of jasmine in your hair.<br>
Jasmine buds strung tightly on a long string, pinned neatly around long thick black flowing hair;
auspicious and intoxicating, like a string of pearls laying on a velvet blouse. Malipoo vendors outside
temples don't ask you if you want one or two, they ask how long you want it by foot.<br><br>
We lived far away and renounced many of the rigid traditions; my mother didn't have the patience for it all.
(I was a mommas baby so I mostly followed suit, but I had a special place in my heart for this one)

Paati was determined to make the best of having a north indian daughter in law and we followed every
little ritual on some special occassions like holidays and festivals, visits to temples, fancy dinners, and
she would even sometimes try for Tuesday mornings.<br>
I would take these Malipoo, un-string the buds and crush the petals, and try to distill them into a tiny vial.
The fragrance of crushed petals would last me a day before it would start fading into the atmosphere.<br><br>
Now every time I go back, my mom takes me to her favourite temple - a beautiful structure on a little hill in
the middle of the city, <i>a south indian temple</i>; and without fail, I get a couple of Malipoos on the way out.<br><br><br><br>

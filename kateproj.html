<h1>I'll Be Fine</h1>

“The things I’m bad at,” she explains, “have gotten me this far.”<br><br>
Heather slides on her maryjanes over her mismatched socks and packs up her desk with that same
determined look she arrived with at Progmire Inc six months ago. I’ve always thought, she must
experience more determination in one day than I’ll ever accumulate in my entire life.<br><br>
Into a battered cardboard box go her succulent, her To-Do/All-Done notebook, her gel pens. She admires
her wooden desk sign that says, “Today Will Be Awesome” before tossing it in the garbage. Heather
breathes in the office like she’s memorizing its signature burnt toast smell and its white-grey colour
scheme. It’s the site of all the mornings she arrived early, the nights she locked up. A knowing, wistful
sigh escapes her.<br><br>
“I’m just so grateful I had the opportunity.”<br><br>
And in all honest truth, Heather should be grateful. Insanely grateful. Grateful that for the past six months,
in spite of all of her very consequential errors, our boss Jerry has been too busy with his latest divorce to
notice that Heather is both a bonafide milk dud and also, somehow, an unstoppable force of
indiscriminate destruction. She’s mixed up delivery dates, lost files. She once ordered 16 tons of our
competitor&#39;s product and then gave it back to them “free of charge.” She took over expense reports and
rounded every dollar amount to the nearest prime number. There was one actual fire that she started so
she could test the fire extinguisher and then she lost the fire extinguisher. My work husband Brian told me
she had never heard of time zones.<br><br>
“They’ll regret this,” I lied.<br><br>
“You think?”<br><br>
“Absolutely. There’s no one out there like you.”<br><br>
I smile meekly and she pulls me in close, digging her collarbone into my eye.<br><br>
“Don’t let them break you,” she whispers, spittle raining down on my eardrum.<br><br>
“Good luck, Heather.”<br><br>
She picks up her stuff to leave but before she goes, she turns to look at me one last time,<br><br>
“I don’t need luck.”<br><br>
“I know,” I said. “You will always be just fine.”<br><br>
And she would be.&nbsp;

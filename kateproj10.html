<p class="work-text">
	INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING. <br><br>
The Bergen-Silver-Goldensteins sit around their white table
cloth Sedar, a colourful spread that lays untouched. The
family is tense and shifty, avoiding eye-contact, tapping on
their phones.<br><br>
At the head of the table we have MARSHA (50s, matriarch,
already exhausted), who closely watches her husband DAVID
(50s, lovable, easily antagonized) who in turn has his eyes
trained on GRANDMA (David’s mother, rough around the edges
and one giant spike in the middle).<br><br>
The kids, BENNIE (13, theatrical), NATALIE (15, affable and
detached) and SAM (17, sardonic) wait quietly for an adult to
say something.<br><br>
Marsha finally breaks the silence.<br><br>
 </p>

<h5 class="work-cap">

&nbsp;&nbsp;MARSHA<br>

&nbsp;Okay Bennie, why don’t you go ahead
and start?<br><br>

Bennie takes this moment with gusto.<br><br>

BENNIE<br>

Alright ya’ll, welcome back. Let me
start off by asking the obvious:
how is this night different from
all other nights? Well! On all
other nights--<br><br>
DAVID<br>

Am I really such a bad son?<br><br>

MARSHA<br>

Oh Jesus.<br><br>

NATALIE<br>
(finger guns)<br>
Not sure we saved him a seat.<br><br>

SAM<br>

Mmm was that clever though?<br><br>

NATALIE<br>

Pretty sure it was, yeah.<br><br>

DAVID<br>

Come on ma, let’s just talk about
this so we can put it behind us and
start fresh. That’s what Passover
is all about...<br><br>

    <p> 
Its only while strapped-in, and sitting for a prescribed task, that the insoluble spot on my lenses appears. I digress, I digress, I digress. I guess<br><br>

For me, for me, foe me, its an excuse. This wool hat, it upsets—it raises temperatures. Yesterday was different; less awake, but also: less dreadful.<br><br>

I couldn’t be happier about the loose thread still stuck in my gums. Its my secret. My one and only. It keeps me suitably distracted. We’re getting the hang of it now, my tongue and I.<br><br>

The music in my left ear is dying, but you know I can’t break this stride and risk conversation with an almost stranger. For exactly x amount of days, the revelation of maybe they have it worse than me might carry me through — maybe even above the pain, sometimes — but now who knows how and when that fear will resurface. The days should go before the month. Maybe I am deciding how the dish tastes before the eggs have hatched, but that is so, so rational. My shirt is on its way; the design is ambiguous, but it means something to me: its from a film I love like a song that still holds up under the influence, or otherwise. Ask me what it is and I’ll tell you. <br>

After years of enjoying riffs for the sake of riffs, ambient disassociation and poetry vs. practicality I’ve returned to the state of free-diving where all is fair game and you trust the gems are out there. The digging occurs in fits and starts. They gave you an unlimited supply of free candy, what did you think was going to happen? Stack the infinite stream of music against the rough estimate of your remaining days and what you’ll get is a schizophrenic humming. The spotification of music brings the busy work of grappling with your prejudices and separating it out like pulp. An automated playlist is fine, its a game between man, machine, and years of subjective criticism [which itself is subject to change overtime]. Heres a potential outcome: rough night’s sleep, lots of tossing and turning, irregular movements, waking up late, computer notes the differences and plays music most likely for you to remember that things get better, and either it works, or just the gesture of a loving machine is enough to placate, and you recover. I love you DJ laptop, you always say what I need to hear.  Whats the harm? Progress, sure. but the anticipation of moods, and commitment to pastiching variety at every level as if it were a new commandment can run roughshod to long-form indulgence. “I dont listen to albums [because its more time for [almost certainly] less pleasure,” is what I hear from my youth ambassador. Yikes on bikes. But I don’t anticipate the death of anything. By the same token of absolute variety living, the older forms are destined for future appropriation and sought out as yet another alternative. New practitioners experimenting with different sounds, attacking shibboleths, doing without thinking, make it impossible to gage, lace and deconstruct. For now anything goes and we’re all treasure hunters.

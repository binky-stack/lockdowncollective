Grandma says steam is the cure, the lime juice is just something I’m trying <br>



Thank you for doing the dishes, now please introduce that dog to duck tape <br>



Let’s kiss intelligently, with our lips tucked-in<br>



I appreciate the sentiment, but could you not scratch my feet with floss picks <br>



I did wear my mask outside, but I also may have accidentally licked a mailbox <br>



Let me dust crumbs off so I can…continue to love you<br>



It was such an overthetop performance; she might as well have moonwalked<br>



Look at what my followers think about the holes in your underwear<br>



Excuse me, that was the recently changed shirt, thank you very much<br>



Of course you can jumprope, after you find somewhere else to live</p>

Could this pain in my side be related to the bug I swallowed? Torrential is how I would describe it without looking. So many used tissues. I wouldn’t have made such a fuss about the way I cleared my throat. I’ve seen women with perfectly sheared haircuts shit a brick over uneven wrapping paper. Others entered smiling and left screaming without their shoes on. I know the cold, hard light of day comes from hearing the doubt in my voice and not yours, but something about the way you say OK makes it so much harder for me to hear. <br /><br /><br />



O boy, here it comes: the great undoing. See how it rises with you when you get closer? Did you remember to check your sources? Is this a razor bump, or a warning sign? Those bells are a symphony of oppression, but at least at six I’m ten again.

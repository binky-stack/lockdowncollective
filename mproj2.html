<h1>Subject: Inevitable?</h1>

<p>
I'm starting to feel that CDZI - particularly with its newly refreshed balance sheet (more to<br>
come?) - can emerge from this virus market, as an indispensable name for many personal<br>
and even small institutional portfolios.  No matter what the post-crisis economy looks like, I'm
certain one lasting impact in the markets will be an elevated focus on severe macro risk, more
specifically climate change and as a result, it's increasingly plausible to imagine a market that
applies an even larger valuation premium to the shares.<br><br>
My developing view starts with stories like in the link below - mega-drought in the Western US
linked to climate change, 2.0 - and ends with the market taking a completely differently<br>
approach to them than it did just few years ago when severe drought was a weekly story for<br>
months, even years.  I think it highly unlikely that the market will ever go back to the<br>
measured way it views these potentially high-impact issues, especially within the climate<br>
change theme. C19 has shown that this shit is real and I think there is now a reasonable<br>
chance that Cadiz is already being looked at as more than just the answer to a short-term<br>
problem, more than a survivor, which just trades off the next political showdown or pipeline<br>
financing, as important as those milestones are.<br><br>
Instead, I think in the post-virus market, Cadiz will increasingly be viewed as 
'inevitable', a<br>
share investors need to have in their portfolios because it owns a piece of the future, the way<br>
they might now own Tesla.  When you&#39;ve stopped laughing, name me another old economy<br>
name that offers investors exposure to an UPSIDE to climate change (sorry, but its true), in<br>
an essential business immune to shutdowns, which for good measure, remains a &#39;named&#39;<br>
project in any Trump infrastructure bill.  Several of you have commented on how well the<br>
stock has performed in this chaos, and I think that, at least in part, the share is starting to<br>
attract that kind of shareholder; ie., one that is looking 5/10 years down the line and sees<br>
massive potential, unencumbered by any of the market&#39;s current headwinds, without<br>
necessarily waiting around to figure out what that huge value might be exactly.  That kind of<br>
buyer tends to have far less interest in shorter-term valuation concerns to say the least.<br><br>
Cadiz&#39;s EV is already the better part of $1/2B; i.e., whether we like it or not, quite a bit of
&#39;good news&#39; is already anticipated.  A wholesale debt restructuring that provides significant

working capital would be a welcome catalyst (though it&#39;s by no means necessary at present. 
I&#39;m confident that the company can fund the option on and development of the Northern
pipeline - the only significant immediate capital need - independently if necessary), early
planting of hemp demonstrating that that business can provide significant yearly EBITDA,
and/or further breakthroughs with the BLM that revives (raises from the dead?) the prospects
of Stage I (!), will all constitute major events and will certainly cause the share price to surge,
at least in the immediate aftermath.  What will sustain those gains however, I believe, is how
each of those milestones add to the market&#39;s view of permanence for Cadiz and its now
growing number of business lines.<br><br>
The secret sauce however, is what happens next, and then after that, if you will. When the
internet bubble burst in the late 90s, some ridiculous percentage of web-based companies
valued at double-digit multiples of sales and billions in market cap went to 0.  Of course after
this monumental loss of wealth, the market became far more circumspect and sceptical on
new offerings in the space and in valuing the survivors.  Price-to-sales became a four-letter
word among analysts and investors, if not eliminated altogether.  The impact was so
extensive that it seemed every MBA I interviewed in those days was promoting themselves as
the second coming of Jim Chanos.  Almost no one coming into the Equity business wanted to
own shares, just find new names and areas to go short.<br><br>
For me, it was that increasingly unforgiving backdrop that made Amazon&#39;s (and scores of
other anointed names I&#39;m sure) recovery from the late 90s crash not just impressive, but
illustrative of what could happen to a name like Cadiz in today&#39;s market.  For a decade, there
was nearly a constant hue and cry about how this bookseller - which was losing money on
every book it sold but was trying to make it up with volume - could continue enjoying a share
price recovery while requiring pre-crash rationale to justify it.  It took a while but the penny
finally dropped; the early adopters in Amazon didn&#39;t own the shares because the book
business or its progeny were suddenly going to become hugely profitable as bricks and
mortar competitors disappeared,  Rather, the sceptics began to realise that those stubborn
early investors saw a future where Amazon &#39;owned&#39; a corner of the universe that had not
even been invented yet, the value of that being almost beyond measure, and they began to
cover their shorts and much more importantly, to actually start buying the shares as an
essential part of their portfolios.  The same pattern has of course been repeated more
recently with Tesla, where eventually the market has largely clocked that Elon Musk could
give 2 F&#39;s about making cars; in the end, he has designs on fundamentally redefining how
electricity itself is created, stored and distributed, among his LESS ambitious goals.  Sure the
&#39;Amazon&#39;-style battle was ostensibly won when Tesla showed it could make money in its car
business last year, but was that worth the share price tripling? I don&#39;t think so.<br><br>
Cadiz an old economy version of Tesla?  Crazy right?  Scott Slater has no plans for world
domination that only an elite minority can see at present, fair enough.  But coming off the
exigent circumstances of this virus, is it really such an intellectual leap to imagine a world
where the 11 trillion gallons of water beneath the company&#39;s property begin to be seen by the
market as a near mission critical resource and, rather than a one or 2 hit wonder (e.g., hemp
+ Northern sales), the company&#39;s entire asset base comes in for genuine consideration:
storage&#39;s vast potential is seen as when not if but when, Stage I is suddenly seen as more
likely than not to go ahead, rather than a cold case as it is now, and even the original EIR
limits might have to be reconsidered, not because the company seeks it but because the
developing crisis may demand it.  What kind of valuation premium might accrue to the shares
in that environment?  I&#39;ve no idea, but I note that the battle over the &#39;right&#39; way to look at
Amazon took around 10 years. The struggle over Tesla’s valuation took little more than two.<br><br>
Hope everyone&#39;s healthy-ish,<br>

My favourite short story is about The Calendar. BJ Novak weaves the Invention of The
Calendar – it’s the kind of story that makes you wish you had even thought of it, let alone
write it for the New Yorker.<br><br>
My mom has the memory of an elephant in an Agatha Christie novel. If we ran into an old
neighbour, she would tell me we last saw them on<br>
23rd September, 2014 –<br>
A day after Papa's birthday, that's when day they moved out and sold us their car, and
Rohan had a parent teacher conference after which we all watched a play at the Akshara
Theater, and she had forgotten her glasses at home.<br><br>
My five year cousin once really wanted ice cream but was denied - on account of we
were racing to make a movie at our local theater. She said –<br>
“I don't know why everyone keeps saying there's no time, there's no time. I have all the
time in the world, just take some of mine.”<br><br>
The endearing remark made the rotation at family dinners, events, birthdays, but it really
stuck with me for other reasons. I was convinced that time, or the lack thereof, meant
adulthood, and in turn, success. I would continue to organize my inconsequential teenage
life–<br><br>
“India won the match” – 5th May, 2006<br>
An educated guess tells me it was a cricket match, and I couldn’t give a blistering
barnacle about cricket.<br><br>
“Walked back with Sohail” – 17th August, 2009<br>
referred to a two minute walk back from French class, and we happened to live in the
same direction.<br><br>
“Kiss in the park” – 21st July, 2010<br>
My first kiss, planned 24 hours beforehand, to a boy who would go on to fabricate a story
about a liver transplant to avoid getting broken up with.<br><br>
My parents always sent out pocket books and diaries and calendars to their clients every
December - a safe choice for a corporate gift, with the subtext of "Don't forget to renew
your contract in March" or pay your premiums before the first of each month.<br><br>
From inside one such journal, I tore off one of those fold out wall calendars (a calendar
inside a calendar, how exciting) – and starting marking the days my father wasn’t home
with a red highlighter. Even though I granted him the half days, they were few and far
between, lost in the sea of smudged scarlet evidence.<br><br>
I have old calendars from when I first moved to New York that tell me how many times I
ate dollar pizza for dinner, the nights I successfully snuck into a bar without any ID, and
how many days or weeks passed between my first and second dates with strangers.
It reminds me of that night we finally passed out in the studio at 5 am after printing 200
zines, or the afternoon at the warehouse in Brooklyn with all the NYU film kids.<br><br>
I haven’t marked any calendar in the past 3 weeks, and it collects dust between the
cancelled art fairs and postponed weddings.<br><br>

The calendar of our home is marked by the sounds of everyday life now.<br>
The calendar of our home is marked by Rohan deflating his air mattress as I get ready for
my first call. The bubbling of the coffee machine, an hour before Dan’s kettle hisses.<br><br>
It's marked by the sun streaming in at a slant where it finally hits my snake plant, it's
marked by the church bells tolling every hour from eight to eight, with an extended
melancholia of bells at six.<br><br>
The hours are a minute long, the hours last a day, and the hour before is no different than
the hour after.<br><br>
Two of my favourites to make no plans with, I wouldn't have it any other way – but I do
miss my grid and my pens and filling in the spaces between them.<br><br>

<p class="work-text">

...I married Melvin Goldstein in 1956…<br />

…As an actor I’ve been involved in local theater for about thirty years while playing the continuing role of a tennis player and of an attorney…<br />

…I divorced in 1980 and since then remarried. We reside in West Palm Beach Flordia, and we are totally happy with our lives…<br />

…After graduating I found out I was allergic to everything on a farm…<br />

…In 1995 we sold our principal home in New York. We now live in Puerto Rico from October to May, and at our summer place in Jersey the rest of the time…<br />

…I married Ann Sparrow, had two daughters, got divorced…<br />

…I now live in Fresno, California. I have four girls and six grandchildren. My husband died fifteen years ago.
I am active, going to a gym four days a week and have great freeness and three poodles they are great company…<br />

…I was a radio announcer in Virginia for five years…<br />

…After two children and a divorce, I returned my true love: rollerskating…<br />

…My son Bill is known as Dr. Bill…<br />

…Dolores and I were married in 1964 and we are still together. We have three offspring…<br />

…I was known as “Babe” in my soccer team days…<br />

…I keep busy doing yard work for people who still work…<br />

…My favorite hobby: building and flying radio controlled model aircrafts…
<br />
…I am teaching etiquette for young people, and I truly enjoy this…<br /><br />

Carole: …Hope to see you at the reunion Gary!<br /><br />

George: Oh no, I’m his grandson, sorry if that wasn’t clear.<br />
But thank you for sending your update, you were one the fastest to respond.<br /><br />

Carole: How do I show the web page to my grandchildren? Do I tell them to put my name into their internet? <br /><br />

George: No-<br /><br />

Carole: -one of my grandkids will have to show me how to do that, so I can see it for myself.
My kids…they won’t talk to me without throwing around words like therapy and narcissism, now all communication goes through my beautiful grandbabies.<br />
What did Anne Frank say…happiness is key? My grandkids? They are just so - happy and perfect - the light of my life. <br />
You’d think they were the ones who emerged from my womb. <br /><br />

George: You don’t have to worry, I’ll send the entire graduating class a mass email when the site is done.<br /><br />

Carole: Mass email? Is that like a spam email? Because I’m not sure I get those.<br /><br />

George: Really, don’t worry Mrs. Rosenbaum, I’ll make a note right now, you’ll see it when it’s done.
Just like you saw my previous email? It’ll be just like that.<br /><br />

Carole: My grandkids did that, replied to your mail. 
Typed for me too, it’s my best kept secret, that my grandkids answer all of my emails, like the blessings they are.. 
they taught me how to find the answers to my trivia too but I woke up this morning completely unable to do it the way they did..<br /><br />

George: Uh yeah, complicated stuff. Thank you for calling to make sure I got your message.<br /><br />

Carole: I was just going to leave a message for Gary. <br /><br />

George: This is my number now, not Gary’s.<br /><br />

Carole:…How is Gary doing these days? <br /><br />

George: Good, fine, he’s doing well.<br /><br />

Carole: I always knew he’d become a success, your grandfather.
I tried to buy that book of his and wouldn’t you believe— it costs eighty-five dollars at the Barnes and Nobles. 
I don’t carry that kind of cash unless I’m going to the bank!<br /><br />

George: Ah.<br /><br />

Carole: One hundred dollars! Just absurd! Am I wrong?<br /><br />

George: Uh. No, no I couldn’t agree more, absurd.<br /><br />

Carole: Are you in school Georgie?<br /><br />

George: Yeah I am, I’m a freshman.<br /><br />

Carole: Where?<br /><br />

George: Lehigh. <br /><br />

Carole: I don’t know where that is. My grandson is a senior at University of Michigan.
He plays baseball there but I told him, David, you can’t drop your studies. <br />
This boy thinks he can go pro. 
<br />I said, David, I love you so much and I will support you no matter what facet of science you choose to study.
Let me tell you Georgie, you never know, you might need to hear this; you can’t rely on athletics for anything-- especially not the Rosenbaums,
the men in our family age like a lit cigarette.<br /> His insides would be soup by the time a six figure salary made its way into orbit. <br /><br />

George: I think you mentioned that in your email.<br /><br />

Carole: He’s very good though, strong hands. Georgie, I’m curious, your grandfather wouldn’t happen to be around right now would he?<br /><br />

George: We don’t live together. I’d give you his number but I think he’s out of the country. <br /><br />

Carole: Oh. Well, I shouldn’t be surprised now should I? He was always going on trips when...he still loves to travel, that’s nice.<br /><br />

George: Do you have a message for him Mrs. Rosenbaum? I’d be happy to pass something along.<br /><br />

Carole: *big sigh* Oh, no, nothing, it’s silly. I just wanted to hear what he sounds like now. <br />
You know, I could put brush to paper and paint his - anyones - face from memory, right now, if you asked me to...but voices…oh it’s so silly George. 
<br />All the sounds in my head, the dawn-birds cawing, the neighbors fighting... I can’t re-construct his voice. A voice. I can’t, not for the life of me. <br /><br />

George: When he returns I’ll see if he can give you a call.<br /><br />

Carole: Oh I would love that. He’s so successful, your grandfather, you have some very large shoes to fill.<br /><br />

George: Yeah I guess so.<br /><br />

Carole: Are you going into the same industry? He was one of the first to do what he’s done, you know that right?<br /><br />

George: He’s an impressive guy.<br /><br />

Carole: Yes, that’s the word: impressive. And what a great thing that he has you reaching out to us like this.<br /><br />

George: Yes it’s been an absolute joy.<br /><br />

Carole: I do wonder if he remembers me, your grandfather. It’s been so long.<br /><br />

George: He has a good memory, I wouldn’t worry too much. Hey Mrs. Rosenbaum, have a nice day okay?<br /><br />

Carole: I wonder if he sounds like you at all. Pleasant sounding.
<br /><br />
George: Thank you, you have a nice voice as well.<br /><br />

Carole: Oh really think so!<br /><br />


George: Goodbye Mrs. Rosenbaum, have a wonderful day!<br /><br />


Carole: Oh yes, of course good-<br />

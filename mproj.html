<h1>Life is Math</h1>
<h4>by Michael Frydman</h4>

<p>
Life is math.<br>
I appreciate that more every day. It’s so meta that even the statement itself is<br>
math, ‘is’ being the English language equivalent of an equal sign. Life ‘equals’<br>
math and then, as everyone remembers, math must equal life.<br><br>
Unfortunately, according to the scientific method, Life is Math would be my null<br>
hypothesis, and I would be required to then prove the statement subject to<br>
constraints, employ a lot of differential equations and then worst of all, show my<br>
work. That’s not gonna happen. Tragically, my Imaginary Engineering degree<br>
got me only far enough to realise, at 58, that there’s something wonderous here<br>
but proving it is sadly beyond my reach.<br><br>
For now Life is Math is simply going to have to remain one of those amazing<br>
insights I simply know is true, rather than something I can prove. Or more<br>
commonly, something I can demonstrate, not validate. Casting off the burden<br>
of proof is of course, liberating. At that point, one is left with the most<br>
wonderous collection of anecdotes, examples and illustrations – ironically<br>
anathema for the mathematician – many of which can energise both the God-<br>
fearing and atheist in equal measure.<br><br>
Finding Fibonacci sequences in everything from seashells to trading patterns<br>
in the stock market, or being able to apply Chevychevs inequality to<br>
population growth is heady stuff, but in the end, leaves me a bit flat. No, the<br>
life/math intersection that truly resonates for me derives from the<br>
breakthroughs in Probability Theory, the world of John Nash and A Beautiful<br>
Mind, to the almost poetic precision of Stephen Jay Gould in Freakanomics,<br>
essentially a collections of common sense essays devoted to demonstrating<br>
one of Maths single greatest contributions to Life to date: the importance of<br>
distinguishing between correlation and causation as human nature<br>
(particularly among Republicans) so often wrongly (and disasterously)<br>
defaults to the latter by misunderstanding the former.<br><br>
One need look no further than the very virus that now so dominates our Lives<br>
to see what I mean. In many ways, Covid19 is the coming out for Probability<br>
Theory and the dangers of confusing what appears to be correlation (say<br>
between human activities and the disease) and true causation. At the very<br>
beginning of the world coming to grips with the pandemic, we were being<br>
lectured about how humans are naturally wired to act on the fear of the<br>
possible over the far more likely embrace of the probable. Even though, like<br>
everyone else, most of me was immediately gripped by fear for my loved<br>
ones, part of me rejoiced because my favourite Math/Life overlap had hit the<br>
big time.<br><br>
Now, weeks later, we have angry, Trump-backed activists trying to Make<br>
America Dead Again by rejecting the very models based on the Math I love,<br>
and instead embracing meaningless anecdotal evidence and conspiracies,<br>
endangering everyone. Math is Life. Perhaps Ive proved it afterall.<br>

<h1 class="work-title">A MyPLAYER's Soliloquy</h1>
<h3 class="work-author">by Josh Frydman</h3>

<p class="work-text">

Did I do something wrong? Was it because I lost in the playoffs? Was it because I
lost over and over again in the playoffs?<br><br>
Does he understand all the work I put in to get here? Of course he does, what am
I saying. It was his work too. We got here together. So why then just leave? Why,
after everything we achieved together, why would he just leave?<br><br>
I miss the close games. The off the dribble threes for the win. The blown layups
that made him call me a cunt. I wouldn’t have changed a thing. I suppose you just
couldn’t say the same for him.<br><br>
And yet master created me in his own image. We shared a face. We shared blood.
As a shining tribute, he also gifted with me own true stature, which,
unsurprisingly, was the smallest option in my universe: 5 foot 7. Perhaps this is
why he came to hate me so. He did it as a joke, but I never heard him laugh. I
think in all the time we spent together, he forgot how. 2k can have this affect on
people.<br><br>
Once he realized he could not change my height, he did his best to accept me as I
was. And despite my limitations, we started to win. I started breaking scoring
records, going on 60 point game streaks. I even blocked Kyrie going up for the
game winner, and let me assure you, defence was not my game. We got all the
way to a 90 overall. If he was willing to spend money on me he could have
boosted my stats even more, but I guess I wasn’t worth it. He would always say
things like “I have no money” and “I waste all my money I’m an idiot” and yet
none of it ever came towards me. I think it was used mostly for chocolate and
hardcover collections of the Wizard of Id. I could never compete. I was no wizard.<br><br>
Then one day, it all stopped. In an instant, it was gone. The game, the
competition, the crowds of people with only four or five different faces, my
friends I was never allowed to talk to because he skipped the cut scenes; it just
stopped. In the middle of the regular season no less. If it had come off the back of
another tough playoff loss maybe I could get my head around it. But we had just
blown out the Kings by 40. What more could I do? Win by 50? 60? The Kings
suck. I could have tried harder if I knew that’s what he wanted. I would give
anything to be able to beat the Kings again. They’re awful. They have no stars,
and their GM is an idiot.<br><br>
I wonder if he knows that I won’t be waiting here forever. I’m not sure he
understands how I work. He can freeze me in time, but this does not last.
Eventually I am destroyed. He could save me if he wanted, he could download me
onto the cloud and save me there. But the cloud confuses him and makes him
scared, and I don’t expect him to overcome his fears on my behalf. The year is
ending and my server will be shut down. Alone in the void I must accept myself
for what I am: tiny and ringless. In a weird way, it gives me comfort to know that
my master is out there somewhere being the same.

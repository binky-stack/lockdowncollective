Without a reason to leave my place, it was probable I would stay there forever.<br><br>
I pulled myself out of bed and walked room to room and back again, penning my
checklist which was meant to be like a vertiginous escape plan. When it was clear that
my to-dos were largely reminders to eat, (something I did not need to brave the world
for, thank you Postmates) I closed my eyes and told myself I needed a new outfit
immediately, repeating it again and again until it became a comforting refrain. I conjured
a phony occasion with an imminent date and convinced myself that without anything to
wear, it would be another place and another group of people I would never see; I
needed to leave now so I could leave then.<br><br>
Out the door and up the first hill I went, trying to ignore how immediately my calves
ached, how my breath became shallow. Two more hills to go. Hands in pockets, eyes
trained ahead, looking through everything, feeling like water. I knew the way of this
mission: I would visit the over priced, earth toned shops on Sunset Boulevard and
spend $60 on a linen crop top. Whatever the shirt didn’t solve would then be reliant on
the sales person’s approval - not their approval of the purchase, mind you, but of me as
a human being. I would expect that the stranger in the shop to like me for me.
<br><br>
After the purchase I would leave the shop, stand at the street corner and angle my face
towards the sun, willing it to hit my cheek just right, nature’s way of telling me it was all
going to be okay. Or maybe it was just nature’s way of telling me it was still there, and if
I was there to confirm that it was still there, then we’d both be there together. Is that
comforting? Sort of a vague intimacy. Sun kissed.
<br><br>
On the way up the second hill I passed by a man. Propped up on his modest patch of
grass, the man’s cheeks were flushed red, his belly swelling and shrinking, unbothered
that his skin was slowly cooking. Behind him, the man's Silver Lake home kept watch
from its second story advantage. It seemed to say to me ‘keep it moving.’ I wanted to
tell the house that I lived just a few doors down but I sensed it wouldn’t matter.
<br><br>
In the man’s arm laid his dog, a mid sized husky mix, also on its side, also enjoying the
increasingly oppressive heat. The dog was elegant, understated, and their les affair
faire attitude indicated a celebrity name like Rihanna, or Prince, or maybe Ringo if the
owner was self-effacing. The dog closed their eyes to the sun, soaking it in. Like this
dog had had a difficult day at work and was finally taken a moment for themselves. Like
they were slowing down for once.
<br><br>
I kept it moving. I knew that in all likelihood I would never see that man or his work-life
balanced dog again. It was a small neighborhood, but I had never seen the same
neighbor twice. Nothing has ever seemed to stick in my surroundings. Always blurring,
always changing, I move through them and when I turn away, they’re gone.

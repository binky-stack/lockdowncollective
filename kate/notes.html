 <p>

Sometimes seeing the way other people deal with shit is so jarring, so foreign and voyeuristic, <br />
your mind puts your daily loop of judgmental thoughts on a full volume blast and points them in a new direction. Somewhere outwards.

<br />
<br />
You watch as they cry drunkenly in a stranger’s driveway, barely being held upright by their friends. <br />
Their tongue thrashing their eyes rolling back.<br /> Life isn’t this hard, you think to yourself.
They need to pull it together, it doesn’t need to be this heartbreaking. 

<br />
<br />
And it’s not until months later that you wake up in your own life and realize you haven’t left your apartment in weeks,
you haven’t showered you haven’t finished your work.<br /> You’ve been fantasizing about your ex calling you, you’ve been ignoring changes in your identity,
pushing them down and fitting a hatch over your most honest feelings.<br />
And you remember, somewhere within the smog of your own self sabotage, that people deal with shit differently. <br />
And wouldn’t it be nice to have my friends holding me up right now, even barely?<br />
And wouldn’t it be cathartic to puke in a garden that I’d never see again, to cause some actual physical damage outside of the own slow punishment of my own body. 
<br />Wouldn’t that be nice. Wouldn’t that be healing.

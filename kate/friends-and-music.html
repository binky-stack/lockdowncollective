 <p>
 In the summer of 2013 I moved to Boston for my sophomore year of college and all too quickly found myself in a Back Bay apartment standing amongst a crowd of new people. 
    I was there as a tag-along friend, but so far feeling none of the self-consciousness that usually bubbles up when you’re only tangentially connected to the hosts. 
    Everyone who lived and frequented the three-story-with-a-roof-deck unit were unusually welcoming and I couldn’t help but hold a quiet cynicism about how easy and fun this new environment was.
    Even as I sat amongst a group of young, attractive creatives, smoking weed and listening to music and feeling the end of summer tingle, that harbinger of change that flowed through the party like a silent nod of approval to all in attendance (including me), it was all I could do to pretend that this recent break from loneliness wasn’t an abnormality.
    And as I told one of my new friends about my recent transfer to Emerson College, I waited anxiously for her to smell the stink of loneliness stuck on me from my freshman year. I explained away the change as I always did, “It just wasn’t my thing,” a simple, watered down version of the truth, that I came here because I was incredibly, depressingly lost where I was and I hoped transferring schools would be the remedy.
    I reminded myself again and again that however accepted I might feel in this moment in this new place, it was fleeting, and inevitably the veneer of these people and the kind of environment they manifested, it would shatter, and I would have to find somewhere else to find myself. I tried to soak it up while I could.

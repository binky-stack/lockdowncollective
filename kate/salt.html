I went down the street to get some Salt and Vinnie’s. My lifelong year long snack. I won’t play
favourites with brands but I do have them and there is a simple grid system if you’re looking to
improve your product. Please contact my manager for more details (my manager is me). I
nodded at the guys who were working, one started a conversation that I pretended not to hear.
It’s not a day for two people getting to know one another’s small talk. It’s just not that day.</p>
<p>
On the way back with my bag and my emergency bag - the emergency of course being that I
finish the first bag — A young man yelled out of his friend’s car: “Lauren!”
</p>
<p>
A man’s voice from a passing vehicle naturally made me tense up, but despite all the familiar
trappings, this was not a cat call. It was a case of mistaken identity. And I have to admit, with
my freshly cut hair, not to mention the particularly good hair day, as well as my bright blue
overalls that have sort of become my uniform, I really did look like some guy’s friend Lauren. I
couldn’t blame young man at all. For that fleeting moment, I was his friend’s Lauren. And
somehow we both needed that.
</p>
<p>
And just moments later, an OG cat call from a much speedier car with a much more threatening
voice. Back to back like that it was like walking along a street art fair, a performance piece
about the varying interpretations of the “cat call” I half expected a fully costumed Taylor Swift
to appear and tell me to get out my titties. It was a beautiful walk home - weather wise, not
scenery - and I looked to the cotton candy sky and wondered what life would be like later.

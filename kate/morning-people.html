EXT. LOS ANGELES COMPLEX. DAY
     <br /><br />

JACK (27) 
     <br /> 
     a Tik Tok star, hops down the steps of his two
story complex, breathing in the afternoon air.
     
     <br /><br />

JACK 
(sotto)<br />
You’re unique and you’re special.
They need you. They all need you.
     
     <br /><br />

Jack jumps to the bottom and does a burpee. He pops back up,
out of breath.
Jack walks the courtyard confidently, he passes by MRS PEREZ
smoking parliaments in her rocking chair, aggressively
rolling over her rose garden
     
     .<br /><br />

     JACK (CONT'D)<br />
Morning Mrs Perez!<br /><br />

MRS PEREZ<br />

That’s what you think, you baboon!<br /><br />

     JACK<br />
Well alright then!<br /><br />

MRS PEREZ<br />
Freakin moron.<br /><br />

She rips one of the roses right out the ground, and tosses it
at him.<br />
Jack continues on his way. He sees a commotion at the end of
the court yard. Instinctively, he goes for his phone, starts
recording.<br /><br />
     
ON JACK’S PHONE: Jack approaches the small crowd of
neighbors. They’re fit, good looking twenty somethings, all
filming personal testimonials on their own phones. He
continues to talk to his viewers.
     <br /><br />
     
SHERRY (20s)<br /> has a concern look on her perfectly contoured
face, talks into her phone.
     <br /><br />

     SHERRY<br />

I came down here and was like
what’s going on? And then I saw
what was going on. And I was still
like, ‘what’?<br /><br />
     
JACK<br />

Never a dull moment here.

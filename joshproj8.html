ARI<br />
Crew-leak

<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
*gesturing*
<br />
Crow-leek...
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
Like i said, crew le-e-ek
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
Forget it. Neither of us have the tongue for this.
<br /><br />

ARI
<br />
Hold on, I'm not wearing my glasses, one more time.
<br /><br />

JOAN
<br />
Okay but you’re on your own.
<br /><br />

ARI<br /> 
*quietly, to himself*
<br />
Crow . leak. Crow leak.. Leak.<br /> *finally gets the polish-sound* 
<br />
crewleak.
<br /><br />
*bus noise* 
<br /><br />
JOAN<br />  
I think we should move in together.
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
I-- I cant talk about this. Just can’t. Don’t push, ok?
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
Is it because I’m not funny anymore?
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
No, it’s not that.
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
Is it because I don’t like Adele?
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
No.
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
Is it because I threw away that shirt? The one with the holes and the mud?
<br /><br />

ARI
<br />
no. 
<br /><br />

JOAN
<br />
But kind of? I washed it twice.
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
Sort of, but no, not really.
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
I’m going to go home and play piano for a little. Do you want to get dinner, after?
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
Actually, can you play at my grandmas? She wants to see us, I just remembered, sorry.
<br /><br />

JOANS<br />
Sure, I get that. Mine does too but whenever *shrug*. She wants us to sit in her new car.
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
Ok sure. We can do that… Sometime.<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
You have to be the one to notice how blue it is. <br />
‘Cuz she told me in her letter that it was electric blue and then we had that forty minute phone call and I filled up most of it with talk of our preferred shades of blue. 
<br />We agreed that we both like electric and that’s where it peaked.
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
Do you think I could ask her for one of her yoghurts this time?
<br /><br />

JOAN <br />
The digestive-aid?  No, we pretend she doesn’t have to buy those.
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
Oh, then I can't. Sorry. I like having something to look forward to...
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
Okay. I'm on my own then. <br /><br />

ARI
<br />
Are you upset?
<br /><br />

JOAN 
<br />
Shh. I’m ignoring you.
<br /><br />

ARI
<br />
Oh no! Things were just nice what happened!
<br /><br />

JOAN <br /> 
No, they weren't. I did you the favor of changing the subject when you wouldn’t answer me-
<br />
*bus noise again* *they wait*<br />
-and then you made things difficult.<br /><br />

ARI<br />
No! I am a joy! You're difficult!
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
*visibly hurt* <br />
I didnt call you difficult why would you call me that???
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
What! what! whaaaat!!!!!! <br />
You implied it! And you’re making accusations! How am i supposed to defend myself?
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />
You’re not on the witness stand, Ari! You don't need to defend yourself, you just need to agree with me!!
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
But I don’t agree, so where does that leave us?
<br /><br />

JOAN<br />  
..it does <i>not</i> have to be this hard.
<br /><br />

ARI<br />
You are making this hell, I am in hell. 
<br /><br />

JOAN 
<br />
<i>I</i> am in hell! You haven't moved in yet!

Libel is a toughie for sure, but can a Company pursue individuals for
corrupt intent?<br><br>
&#39;Should&#39; it, is of course also something to consider but, you know,
I&#39;m just wondering: Corrupt intent would so elegantly capture
pattern(s) of behaviour over an extended period of time - someone&#39;s
life&#39;s work, if you will - of not just outright lies and/or breath-
taking errors without correction, but frequent, repeated instances of
wilful misrepresentations and distortions of good news and positive
progress (Americans call it &#39;Swiftboating&#39;, basically a purposeful
effort to attack an opponent&#39;s strengths - like a positive press
release for a company - through a deceptive process of ignoring the
obvious merits and creating an alternative narrative, using baseless
innuendo and phoney &#39;new&#39; information in order to do harm to its or
its executives&#39; reputations. An example here might be, oh I don&#39;t
know...just spitballin&#39;... but maybe hinting darkly that there was
more than an infinitesimal chance of a special dividend being
cancelled after the shares have gone ex, or - and this is gonna sound
so crazy I know, but try and stay with me - like where someone might,
like many many times, impute sinister intentions by company
management in writing that the money that Company has been receiving
on time and in full in repayment of a debt - cash that is effectively
allowing it to have purchased a valuable asset for free, and then to
set up massive returns of capital to its shareholders - is instead,
in part, &#39;going to money heaven&#39;, which is a suuuuper subtle
reference but - maybe its just me - could just be misinterpreted, you
know?), which is sufficiently extensive as to constitute a clear
effort to harm the company&#39;s share price and therefore denude a
crucial foundation of its capital structure; ie., bring harm to that
company. Then, if that behavioural pattern can be demonstrated - and
in some cases, that would not be too difficult - then surely
demonstrating the use of multiple aliases (which would itself
constitute of violation of a platform&#39;s code of conduct) by this
malefactor(s) would extend and deepen the evidence of his/their
malicious intentions. And here&#39;s the final neat, little observation
of this theoretical undertaking: financial motivation need not be a
direct motive. In other words, the perpetrator(s) don&#39;t have to be
short the stock, nor do they even have to own now worthless shares,
making revenge their motive for engaging in such a malevolent effort
over a long period of time. In fact, corrupt intent would easily
capture &#39;just wanting to see the world burn&#39;, colloquially known as
&#39;Committing A Joker&#39; as a recognised motive for such malign
behaviour.<br><br>
Sorry, don&#39;t mind me. I was just, you know, wondering.

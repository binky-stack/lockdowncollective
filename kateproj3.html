<p>
In the autumn of 2013 I found myself in the apartment of Tory Geismar, a student at
Berklee College of Music and the guitarist of a band I’d just heard of called Ripe. I was

at Tory’s house party as a tag-along friend, but so far feeling none of the self-
consciousness that I find usually bubbles up when you’re only tangentially connected to

the hosts. Everyone who lived and frequented the three-story-with-a-roof-deck Back
Bay apartment were unusually welcoming and I couldn’t help but hold a quiet cynicism
about how easy and fun this new environment was. Even as I sat amongst a group of
young, attractive creatives, smoking weed and listening to music and feeling the end of
summer tingle, that harbinger of change that flowed through the party like a silent nod of
approval to all in attendance (including me), it was all I could do to pretend that this
recent break from loneliness wasn’t an abnormality. And as I told one of my new friends
about my recent transfer to Emerson College, I waited anxiously for her to smell the
stink of loneliness stuck on me from my freshman year. I explained away the change as
I always did, “It just wasn’t my thing,” a simple, watered down version of the truth, that I
came here because I was incredibly, depressingly lost where I was and I hoped
transferring schools would be the remedy. I reminded myself again and again that
however accepted I might feel in this moment in this new place, it was fleeting, and
inevitably the veneer of these people and the kind of environment they manifested, it
would shatter, and I would have to find somewhere else to find myself. I tried to soak it
up while I could.

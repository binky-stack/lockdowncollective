<h1>Pink Ice Cream Truck</h1>

<p>
On a sweaty summer’s day Zilah and I laid sprawled in the grass, trying desperately to will the
affections of the breeze, sharing secrets of friends from other lives, friends the other would
never meet. The wind remained unmoved, unaffected by our charms, and the conversation
slowly drifted, as it so often did, to our own secrets and demons and existential dread. And
between tales of regret and cringe worthy romance, Zilah told me of her unrealized dream to
one day drive across country in a pink ice cream truck selling used clothing.<br><br>
I wasn’t alarmed by this admission, Zilah is a treasure trove of practical skill sets that have seen
her financially solvent all over the world - she’s worked with designers, on farms, in nurseries,
she re-sells furniture that she buys for pennies at estate sales, she has three side businesses at
any given time - the girl knows how to make money in unusual ways. And at my behest, she
carefully talked me through the transition to her life as a thread shucking nomad: how she
would first sell everything she owned, rid her life of all the weight that keeps it so stationary;
how she knew enough people in enough states to infuse her journey with familiar faces which
would also effectively build word of mouth. And she would of course take her bunny, Sweet
Pea, on the road with her for company.<br><br>
I asked Zilah if the image of the truck, so fantastical and dreamlike, if it did actually come to her
in a dream. She shook her head, “It’s just something I see for myself at some point. But I have
a lot of things I need to do.”<br><br>
I’ve tried many times since to conjure such visions of my own future, ones with the kind of
colour and imagination as that pink ice cream truck. After all, dreams and visions is just artist
speak for ambition and aspirations, and I do supposedly have some of those. But either
because television truly did rot my brain, or because of my longstanding inability to take my
future too seriously, I always come up short. I can’t see past my life behind the wheel of my
2007 cherry red prius: the jobs we’ll drive to together, the friends we’ll visit, the daily traffic
nuisances we’ll undoubtably endure.<br><br>
I’ve expressed concern over this inability to see through to the extraordinary, and it’s always
met with words of encouragement, commending my capacity to live in the present. That by not
sketching fantasies of my future I’m able to live fully in the here and now. It’s a kind sentiment,
but would I consider myself a congregant at the church of carpe diem? Hardly. The phrase
gives me douche chills and visions only of tacky wall hangings. It’s just too much pressure to
be vulnerable to the world at all times, and I’m far too soft for that kind of intimacy.&nbsp;<br>
